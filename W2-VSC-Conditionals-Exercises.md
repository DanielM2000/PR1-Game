1. Extend exercise 6 from Week 1 to output a message if the user is 18 or older.    
  2. Write a program that enables a student to enter a letter grade (A, B, C, D, E or F), then convert that to a university undergraduate classification (1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd, ordinary, fail).   
  3. Output the digits between the range of 0 to 9 using a loop.    
  4. Write a program that uses a loop to efficiently print the "seven times multiplication table". The output on screen should resemble the following:   
  1 x 7 = 7  
  2 x 7 = 14  
  3 x 7 = 21  
  4 x 7 = 28   
  5 x 7 = 35  
  6 x 7 = 42  
  7 x 7 = 49   
  8 x 7 = 56  
  9 x 7 = 63   
  10 x 7 = 70  
  11 x 7 = 77   
  12 x 7 = 84   
  5. Now extend the previous program to ask the user to choose which number they would like to see (for example, they input 5 to then see the five-times-table or they enter 9 for the nine-times-table).   
  6. Write a program that asks the user to enter an exam mark (0-100). Write conditional statements to print out the grade they would achieve from this mark.  
  7. Write a program that will print only even numbers from a loop that repeats 10 times.       
  8. Amend exercise 5 from Week 1, which requires feet and miles to be output.   
  9.
