1. Extend exercise 6 from Week 1 to output a message if the user is 18 or older. 
  2. Output the digits between the range of 0 to 9 using a loop.  
  3. Write a program that will efficiently print the "seven times multiplication table". The output on screen should resemble the following:   
  1 x 7 = 7  
  2 x 7 = 14  
  3 x 7 = 21  
  ...   
  12 x 7 = 84 
  3. Write a program that asks the user to enter an exam mark (0-100). Write conditional statements that will print out which grade they would achieve from this mark.
  4. Write a program that will print only even numbers from a loop that repeats 10 times.     
  5. Amend exercise 5 from Week 1, which requires feet and miles to be output.
