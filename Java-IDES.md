# The Best Java IDEs for 2020
There are three main professional IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) for Java:-
1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Apache NetBeans 12.1
3. Eclipse 
  
They all support Git and GitHub, see.  [What Will Be The Best Java IDEâ€™s in 2020?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-will-be-the-best-java-ides-in-2020/) or [Best Java IDE 2020 | Most Popular Java IDE](https://hackr.io/blog/best-java-ide)

#### [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or 
![IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/BNU-CO452/BlueJ-Apps/blob/master/images/IntelliJ_IDEA.jpg)   

IntelliJ can generate UML Class diagrams from Java code, but unfortunately the free community edition of IntelliJ does not contain that feature. 
Students and teachers using their university email addresses can create an account and download the full Ultimate edition which can create classes diagrams as shown below.

The video below is only 4 minutes and will give you a good idea how different a professional IDE is compared to BlueJ.

[Using Git in IntelliJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzRMOCBorg&t=2s&ab_channel=LaunchCode) is a good introduction into putting your IntelliJ project under Git   
Unfortunately it does not match the current version of IntelliJ so you may need to read [Setting up a Git Repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/set-up-a-git-repository.html#check_project_status)   
 
#### JDeveloper by Oracle
![JDeveloper IDE](https://github.com/BNU-CO452/BlueJ-Apps/blob/master/images/JBuilder%20IDE.jpg)
This java IDE is freely available, and has a built in set of diagrams including Class Diagrams and Use Case diagrams

#### [Apache NetBeans 12.1](https://netbeans.org/features/index.html)
Netbeans has a Visual Paradigm plugin for UML however you have to have a licence for Visual Paradigm Standard edition or higher.
#### [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/)
Eclipse is free, and has a number of Git and UML plugins that are also free.  I have moved App05 to Eclipse and ran it successfully in Eclipse with only one change to the main method (it requires String [] args as a parameter to main()).  You might like to watch the video below to get a feel for using Eclipse as opposed to BlueJ.  It looks the best choice of IDE which includes reverse engineering of Java to UML.
