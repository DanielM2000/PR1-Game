# The Best Java IDEs for 2022
Visual Studio Code can be used to develop applications in Java and many other languages.
There are also three main professional IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) specifically for Java:-
1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Apache NetBeans 12.1
3. Eclipse 
  
They all support Git and GitHub, see.  [What Will Be The Best Java IDEâ€™s in 2020?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-will-be-the-best-java-ides-in-2020/) or [Best Java IDE 2020 | Most Popular Java IDE](https://hackr.io/blog/best-java-ide)

## Visual Studio Code (75%)
Visual Studio Code is now by far the most popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with 75% of professional coders preferring it.  Visual Studio comes next with 30% preferring it (but cannot be used with Java) and then IntelliJ is third preferred by 29% of professionals.

## [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (29%)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or 
![IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/BNU-CO452/BlueJ-Apps/blob/master/images/IntelliJ_IDEA.jpg)   

IntelliJ can generate UML Class diagrams from Java code, but unfortunately the free community edition of IntelliJ does not contain that feature. 
Students and teachers using their university email addresses can create an account and download the full Ultimate edition which can create classes diagrams as shown below.

The video below is only 4 minutes and will give you a good idea how different a professional IDE is compared to BlueJ.    
[Running IntelliJ IDEA for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0efB_CKOYo&ab_channel=IntelliJIDEAbyJetBrains)    
[Using Git in IntelliJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzRMOCBorg&t=2s&ab_channel=LaunchCode) is a good introduction into putting your IntelliJ project under Git   
Unfortunately it does not match the current version of IntelliJ so you may need to read [Setting up a Git Repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/set-up-a-git-repository.html#check_project_status)   

## [Eclipse (12%)](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/)
Eclipse is free, and has a number of Git and UML plugins that are also free.  I have moved App05 to Eclipse and ran it successfully in Eclipse with only one change to the main method (it requires String [] args as a parameter to main()).  You might like to watch the video below to get a feel for using Eclipse as opposed to BlueJ.  It looks the best choice of IDE which includes reverse engineering of Java to UML.

## [Apache NetBeans 12.1 (5%)](https://netbeans.org/features/index.html)
Netbeans has a Visual Paradigm plugin for UML however you have to have a licence for Visual Paradigm Standard edition or higher.
