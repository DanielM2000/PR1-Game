1. Continuing from the previous week, create a Module class with attributes (module) name, (module) code. The module name and code should be passed into the constructor.  
  2. In your Course class (from the previous week), add an attribute that is an instance of the ArrayList class. Then in your Course constructor, add four module objects (with module names and codes) to the module arraylist. 
  3. Now modify the print method of the Course class to output the details of the four modules.       
  4. Check that this is printed correctly.  
  5. Now write a random number generator that will return a number between 0 and 100. Use this to assign a mark to each of the modules.
