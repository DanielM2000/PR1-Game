1. Within the Main.java file, add a line of code within the main method that will output the text "Hello World!" to the screen. Compile and execute the program to check that it works as required. Commit and push your changes to Main.java to your repository.

2. Now amend Main.java to enable the program to enter a user's name and store in a variable. Change the output of "Hello World!" so that the program outputs a personal greeting to the name entered (for example "Hello Simon!"). 
 
3. Design a program that asks the user to enter values for the length and height of a rectangle and then outputs the perimeter and area of the rectangle to the screen.

4. What is the difference between the Main.java file and the main.class file? 

5. Write a program that allows the user to enter two integer values. The program should then output the original order they were entered, then output the values in reverse order (swapped). 

6. Design a program that allows a user to type in their age. The program should then work out which year they were born and output this to the screen. 

7. Now modify your solution to question 6, and instead ask the user to type in their date of birth. The program should then calculate how many days old they (from today's date). Consider how you will store the components of the users date of birth (DOB) - which consists of day, month and year.  

7. Design a program that allows a student grade (letters between 'A' and 'F') to be entered - which data type should be used?
