## GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop is the recommended way of using Git without having to use the command line.  There are however many other ways of using Git, including using it directly with command line actions.

Something that was not explained is that version control system can only work with text files such as txt or java code files.  Do not try this with MS Word documents.  OneDrive (or other cloud systems) can cope with sharing and editing and it does keep a history of all the different saved versions.  What OneDrive cannot do is create branches or forks.
## Collaborating on GitHub (pull-requests)

## How to work as a Team in GitHub
* One team member (project leader) sets up a GitHub repository by Using the App06 template.
* The project leader then adds the other team members as **collaborators**.
* The collaborators will **clone** this repository
* Every time you start to code, **pull down** any changes made by other team members
* Every team member can make many local commits
* Add an **issue** whenever you spot something you think is wrong, or something that can be done better
* Team members only **push up** those commits once they compile and they have been tested.
* Alternatively create a new **branch**, push and create a **pull request**.
