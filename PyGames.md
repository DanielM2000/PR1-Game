Once installed, I had no difficulty in starting my first Python game using Visual Studio Code with the Python for VS Code extension installed.

## PyGame Tutorial Series
I have only just started this series, but the seem ok, in that they are relatively short, and the topics covered
fit in well with the game requirements for App05.  So if you want to learn Python have a go!

## Python Best Practices

1. Naming conventions in Python are very different to Java and C#.  
2. Most variables and methods are in lowercase with an underbar__used to separate multiple words in a name.  
3. Variables in the module are not available inside any added functions if they have not been declared as global
4. Indentation is mandatory (in methods, loops and if statements for example)
