This week's exercise attempts to bring together all the concepts we have looked at over the past weeks. This exercise will be good preparation for your first assignment. You may notice some similarities between this exercise and your assignment! 

1. Create classes for Product, StockList and StockDemo. 
  2. The Product class should contain attributes for id, name and quantity. It should also contain a constructor, setter and getter methods for the attributes, in addition to the print method which will display the values for each product object. 
  3. The StockList class should instantiate the ArrayList class (remember to import) to create a collection of products. The class should also define methods to add product objects to the products collection and remove product objects from the collections. It should also contain a method to search the collection via an attribute.     
  4. Next, define a StockDemo class which will define 'test' methods. These test methods should define the code to create product objects, add them to the products ArrayList in StockList, remove them, print them, and search via an attribute. 
  5. Then finally in main, instantiate the StockDemo class and call the run method to initiate the program.
